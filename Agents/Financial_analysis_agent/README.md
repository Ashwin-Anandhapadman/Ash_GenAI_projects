In this project, I have tried to create an AI agent using Groq API and Phi data for performing stock analysis.
This project used various tools (like YFinance tools and DuckduckGo) available under Phi Data for performing web search and stock analysis.

Key info on the features used:
1. YFinanceTools: Tracks stock prices, company news, analyst recommendations, and historical prices.
2. DuckDuckGo: searches the web and provides results tailored to your query.
3. Web search agent and financial analysis agent: these agents perform comprehensive, real-time search on web as well as financial analysis of various stocks.
4. Multi AI agent: It seemlessly integrates the web search agent and the financial analysis agent to report the results of the stock analysis.


I would like to thank popular AI/ML mentor Krish Naik for his lectures on creating such AI agents.
